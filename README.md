### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
I am a recent graduate from Lambda School. I'm currently working on a couple personal projects to stay fresh after school. My solo project will be a stat tracker site for an upcoming videogame, and I have another site I am working on with a colleague for small businesses and teachers to create forms with other features planned in the future.

I'm looking to find a role as an entry level Software Engineer on either front-end or back-end. I like to work closely with a team, but also like working alone from time to time. I am always looking to learn more so I am not intimidated by having to learn other languages or frameworks. 

Feel free to ask me any questions about my pinned projects for further details.

The best way to reach me will be through LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashtonthedev/)
